Apollo 11 was the first crewed spacecraft to land on the moon in 1969. The mission was launched from Cape Kennedy on July 16, 1969, and carried astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the lunar surface on July 20, 1969.

The mission lasted about eight days from launch to splashdown. The lunar module Eagle landed in the Sea of Tranquility, and Armstrong famously declared "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind" as he stepped onto the surface.

The astronauts collected lunar samples and conducted scientific experiments during their 21.5 hours on the moon. They returned to Earth on July 24, 1969, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean where they were recovered by the USS Hornet.
